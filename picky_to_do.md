and lets have a history of changes stored with the character in a compressed/efficent format that can inspected and re-hydrated
character creation process should be- GM logs in. opens a campaign (Or r creates one). Clicks "Make a new character. Generates a link- that link is a compressed string that hydrates basic details and pulls the more complex info. Perhaps a base 64 of campaign name, gm name, character id for that campaign
Characters need names, classes, species, backgrounds
Also need a place to store items 
and feats or class features chosen, 
spells learned,
bastion features
and these things need to be editable by the GM and displayed to the player unless blank- ie don't show spells to the player if they have none
